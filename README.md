# airline-flight-price-prediction
Airline industry is one of the most sophisticated in its use of dynamic pricing strategies to  maximize revenue, based on proprietary algorithms and hidden variables. Therefore, it is  challenging for consumers to predict the price change just by observation. In this project, I built up models to predict the airlineâ€™s flight ticket prices.
